High-performance and modular C drivers for the following sensors, tailored for real-time quadcopter applications:
- **BMP388** ‚Äì Digital Barometric Pressure and Temperature Sensor  
- **BMI160** ‚Äì 6-axis Accelerometer and Gyroscope  
- **HMC5883L** ‚Äì 3-axis Digital Compass (Magnetometer)

Each driver is written in portable, dependency-free C language and is designed for easy integration with STM32 and other ARM Cortex-M MCUs using HAL or bare metal I2C/SPI interfaces.
The driver libraries for BMP388 and BMI160 are the official libraries of Bosch and ported to the STM32 platform.
